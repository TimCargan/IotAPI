#Users
This part of the API is just for dealing with users. Standard JSON user object that will be returned looks as follows:
```
{
	"v": 0,
	"id": "5681f9abd6f45f8f98c69dfe",
	"istemp": false,
	"email": "son@gmail.com",
	"path": "t3",
	"username": "T3",
	"dob": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
	"name": {
	"fullname": "Tim Cargan",
	"nickname": "Tim"
	}
}
```
The current auth flow is cookie bassed, however Once the auth middleware is develped in additon to cookies, tokens can and will be used. Once that is in place a better auth flow will be set up. However some things will like remain the same

* Session state will persist accross the token e.g
	Any API limits will apply to the token

* Rate limmits will exist be applied to the user and are token agnostic. This is in additon to standard IP rate limmiting etc.
